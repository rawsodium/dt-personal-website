        hi there, my name is deanna (she/her)
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a second year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Music Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about software engineering, audio engineering, and the intersection between the two. In the future, I hope
        to work on developing audio plugins, digital audio workstations, and other music related software. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I love tinkering with new tools and technologies, and I'm always eager to learn. I'm currently working on improving
        this website and visualizing music data, both of which are using tools I haven't made much use of before. 
      </p>

        I didn't discover my passion for computer science until I came to college. Originally, I was studying engineering, and the work
        we did with C++ made me fall in love with coding. Being able to write a program from start to finish that works
        was a very satisfying feeling.

        Some interesting tidbits about me:
        <ul>
          <li>I've been collecting records since 2018, and I've built my collection to over 200 albums and singles. 
            I like to collect albums from the 1960s to the present day. You can find my entire collection <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/deannat/collection?header=1" target="_blank">here</a></li>
          <li>I'm a multi-instrumentalist. The instruments I play:
            <ul>
              <li>Violin, for 11 years</li>
              <li>Guitar (electric and acoustic), for 5 years</li>
              <li>Bass Guitar, for 2 years</li>
              <li>Piano (a basic amount), for 1 year</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I did mixed martial arts for 11 years, nearly earning a black belt.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
