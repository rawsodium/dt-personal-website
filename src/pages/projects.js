            I consider this website a little corner of the internet where others can get to know me a little better.
            I want to be able to showcase some of the things that I normally don't get to. It's still very much a work in
            progress, but I'm working on rolling out updates. This was built as a way for me to strengthen my web development skills,
            and also to learn how to use React.js. Next on my to-do list for this site is to work with Spotify's API to be
            able to play some of my favorite music through the homepage!

            This project is a collection of visualizations of my personal record collection. I constructed the datasets for my
            albums and singles using information from Discogs.com, a website I have been using to keep track of my records since
            2020. I used numPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries to break down the datasets and construct graphs charting attributes such as genre, location of manufacture, year of
            pressing, and more. I compiled all of my findings into a Jupyter Notebook file for easy viewing of my work.

    <h2>Image Processor | October - December 2022</h2>
      <h3>Java, JUnit, Swing</h3>
        <ul>
          This project was created for my Object-Oriented Design class (CS3500) at Northeastern University. The task
          was to create an image-processing application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and various
          object-oriented design patterns. The application has a GUI built in Swing, and implements support for image
          transformations such as blur, sharpen, filter, flip, load and save. It was created using test-driven development,
          and was tested using the JUnit framework.

            This was a game created with a team of five other friends for HackBeanpot 2022. The goal of the game is
            to breed a goose with the best possible combination of traits. I worked on rendering the display of each goose's
            traits, as well as composed some of the background music. This was my first hackathon, and overall a fun learning
            experience!
