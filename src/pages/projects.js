      <h3>C++, JUCE Framework</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          tSaturator (pronounced as saturator) is a tape saturation audio plugin built with C++ and the JUCE framework. 
          It mimics harmonic distortion and noise from vintage tape machines. tSaturator allows for controlling the amount of saturation, 
          the drive, and the wet/dry mix of the signal, as well as the amount of noise (or hiss) mixed in with the affected signal. 
          There is also a spectrum analyzer, allowing users to see what the frequency spectrum looks like post-processing. 
          It works as both as VST and an AU, meaning it can be used across a variety of digital audio workstations to add some more character to audio.
          This was my capstone project for my degree.

          This was the final project for my Embedded Audio Programming (MUST3603) class. We developed a real-time ping-pong delay in C++ using the Bela board.
          We designed and built circuit with trimmers to control feedback, wet/dry mix, volume and gain, and implemented a low pass filter to control excess 
          noise from the circuitâ€™s trimmers. This was my first experience working with embedded real-time audio processing.

            I consider this website a little corner of the internet where others can get to know me a little better.
            I want to be able to showcase some of the things that I normally don't get to. It's still very much a work in
            progress, but I'm working on rolling out updates. This was built as a way for me to strengthen my web development skills,
            and also to learn how to use React. Next on my to-do list for this site is to work with Spotify's API to be
            able to play some of my favorite music through the homepage!

            albums and singles using information from Discogs.com, a website I have been using to keep track of my records since
            2020. I used numPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries to break down the datasets and construct graphs charting attributes such as genre, location of manufacture, year of
            pressing, and more. I compiled all of my findings into a Jupyter Notebook file for easy viewing of my work.

          This project was created for my Object-Oriented Design class (CS3500) at Northeastern University. The task
          was to create an image-processing application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and various
          object-oriented design patterns. The application has a GUI built in Swing, and implements support for image
          transformations such as blur, sharpen, filter, flip, load and save. It was created using test-driven development,
          and was tested using the JUnit framework.

            This was a game created with a team of five other friends for HackBeanpot 2022. The goal of the game is
            to breed a goose with the best possible combination of traits. I worked on rendering the display of each goose's
            traits, as well as composed some of the background music. This was my first hackathon, and overall a fun learning
            experience!

        and be able to spot where the closures are, instead of corroborating information through various sources. I'm still working on
        architecting the data flow, but the general plan is to grab data from MBTA's public API, clean it up, store it in Postgres as a series of
        nodes and edges and refreshes every 12-24 hours or so. The map will be done with vis.js, which </p>
